# F5 Log Visidata Plugin

This plugin supports the default log format for:
  - `/var/log/ltm*`
  - `/var/log/gtm*`
  - `/var/log/apm*`
  - `/var/log/audit*`

It extracts common log entries, particularly around monitoring, iRules and configuration change audits. It tries to extract data into common fields to assist rapid filtering.
